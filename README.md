ROOTED NETHUNTER FOR BOTH ROOTLESS AND ROOTED DEVICES

Approx 45min - 1hour depending on your network. minimum device requirements 2gb ram, 10-12gb storage

Dependicies

Download termux for droid either via this link or via the github repository I suggest you do not download the google play store one as it has no regular updates: https://fdroid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk 
Also I reccomend this VNC apk for your desktop environment:
https://github.com/gujjwal00/avnc

After termux installation open termux to set it up by following these steps 
(Copy&Paste 1by1 & Y for Everything): 

pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install x11-repo -y && apt update -y && apt full-upgrade -y 

termux-setup-storage 

pkg install git

pkg install python 

pkg install python3

pkg install wget 

pkg install curl

pkg install cmake

pkg install rust

pkg install proot

pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y

Now your terminal is setup lets move onto the kali install:

(SIDE NOTE:
If install stops repeat this in your cmd line until instalation continues it gets and installs missing pkgs  
apt --fix-broken install 
if you are really stuck look at my SS if not feel free to contact me)

(Copy&paste 1by1):

pkg install wget openssl-tool proot -y && hash -r && wget https://<i></i>raw.githubusercontent.com/EXALAB/AnLinux-Resources/master/Scripts/Installer/Kali/kali.sh && bash kali.sh

After kali has installed start it by inputting: 
./start-kali.sh

Once your cmd line changes to root@localhost:~# continue following my steps.
(Copy&paste 1by1):

wget https://<i></i>raw.githubusercontent.com/EXALAB/AnLinux-Resources/master/Scripts/DesktopEnvironment/Apt/Xfce4/de-apt-xfce4.sh --no-check-certificate && bash de-apt-xfce4.sh

Just follow the installation steps after installation carry on following my steps
(Copy&paste 1by1):

apt update -y && apt full-upgrade -y 

apt install -y kali-linux-nethunter 

Follow the installation instructions for the kali nethunter install. FYI yes for everything, for kismet put yes enter then leave blank and press enter. Remember if install stops just input on your cmd line 
apt --fix-broken install you might have to do this a couple times to install your missing packages dont worry its not broken error's it will restart itself. Also if it feels like its doing nothing leave it its configuring the packages in the background, DO NOT CLOSE TERMUX OR END THE PROCCESS YOU WILL HAVE TO REDO EVERYTHING 

Continue following my steps.
(Copy&paste 1by1):

apt install apt-file

apt-file update

Run this one more time:
apt update -y && apt full-upgrade -y 

If nothing needs doing type exit then Ctrl alt z then exit x2 then enter

Restart termux and input ./start-kali.sh if nethunter was a successful install your cmd line should now say ┌──(root㉿localhost)-[~] ignore the message from kali devs as you will at this point have nethunter fully installed and setup its just an advertisement and input touch ~/.hushlogin. 

After input: 

apt-get update -y

apt-get upgrade -y

apt autoremove

Double check nothing needs doing with:

apt update -y && apt full-upgrade -y 

if nothing needs to be done then input vncserver to start the desktop. Then log in on your VNC apk. Input what it says in termux into your vnc server apk.

local host = 127.0.0.1 port number will be showing more than likely will be 5902.
Then when it asks for your password, input the password you created earlier

Once you are logged into your nethunter desktop go back into termux and input, 

vncserver -kill :1 

As this is what we used to create our desktop earlier and is no longer needed once we are logged in on a fresh desktop environment. To exit nethunter and termux after using repeat some of the previous steps we took.

If black screen on vnc startup input:

vncserver -kill

chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup 

vncserver 

please go to this repository of mine to update nethunter 
https://github.com/Zlocrax/Kali-update

I am on a rootless device but as you can see I have rooted nethunter. I have spent my own free time working on this. So any feedback would be much appreciated thank you, any questions feel free to ask.

A better way to install NH as kali broke the nethunter code 2023, my way the rooted way is now one of the only ways as of 2024 with 0 errors 0 bugs 0 stress. I have spent hours puzzling the Pieces together to get it working again of my own free will, so Everyone can have access to a linux distro. No matter if your Device is rooted or not and best part about it it doesnt touch your main OS so enjoy my freinds.

With thanks to https://github.com/EXALAB and https://github.com/gujjwal00 who without them this wouldn't be possible
